*Winning Best VR Hack*

On the final year of my Diploma studies, our lecturer recommended us to join a hackathon. He felt that it would be a good experience for us, teaching us how to manage our time well and plan our projects effectively, having only one day to finish the project. Two teams from my class signed up for the hackathon. Of the two teams, my team had the least experience participating in hackathons. 

The hackathon's objective was to come up with a VR/AR application and create a demo to pitch to the judges. These had to fulfill one or more categories that SUTD had chosen and annouced to us prior to the hackathon.

*The categories in the hackathon*

We chose to create a educational VR application that would incorporate the properties of electrical circuits (mainly parallel vs in series) and gamify it into a tower defence game. Players would be asked to build up their defence by combining towers, wires and an energy source. They had to make complete circuits with the pieces in order to power the towers. The strength of the towers is affected by the configuration of the circuit. Not only that, enemies could break the pieces that the player placed down, meaning redundancy was part of their concern as well. This would impart the different properties of circuits in parallel and in series to players.
